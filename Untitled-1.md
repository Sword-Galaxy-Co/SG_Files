Before I forget this will run like D&D if you know it good.

If not, I will explain it for how it works in lore...

You will talk to my vessel "Writer" with the options you are given.

In a way you are helping Writer find you a new story to live though. 

What ever you put into the box the said/say User, will be what we call you.
    *began the Story*
        ???: "Hello I guess you have some questions, first off you are dead, Second-
            *${handle} cut the voice off*
                ${handle}: "What do you mean I am dead?"
                ???: "Yes you have died... I thought not having a body told you this?"
                    ${handle}: "Oh, I didn't even notice I didn't have one."
                        ${handle}:"Can you please continue"
                        ???:"Yes I can, you may have noticed that this 'afterlife' or what you will call it seems off. That is because I had interfered with where you would end up."
                            ${handle}:"You can do that?"
                                ???:"Yes I can, your story endded so abroftly I want to read a new one made by you. As you can see this is a Library, so to say, the realm you are in is based on the 'Tower of Babel' but we have 4 visual sections, as you can see." *The voice seem to now have a physical form, looks human but some details seem to change, mainly what seems to be a brith mark that moves form the right wrist (a oval with stars in it) up the arm then it wraps around the right shoulder (think a line around the whole joint), then you notice the outfit has a hole right on the collarbone followed by the mark moving and becoming a heart in the middle of the hole, then it runs to the back, then back to the right wrist* "Oh where are my manners, you can call me **Writer**."
                                    ${handle}:"..."
                            ${handle}:"Okay"
                    ${handle}:"I am still in shock over it all, sorry"
            *${handle} stays quiet*
                ???:"Yes I can, you may have noticed that this 'afterlife' or what you will call it seems off. That is because I had interfered with where you would end up."
